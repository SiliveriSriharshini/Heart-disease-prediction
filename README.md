# Heart-disease-prediction
* Prediction of Heart disease and identifying False Negatives and False Positives
* Prediction of Heart disease using data provided and built a predictive model and calculated the error in prediction like MSE, MAE, F2_score, etc.
* Heart disease prediction is a Classification Problem. Used classification models such as Random Forest Ensemble, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, etc., and compared their 
  results.
* Identification of False negatives and False positives is more important and they are calculated using a confusion matrix. Also calculated the Precision and accuracy of the 
  classification model.
