# Heart-disease-prediction
Prediction of Heart disease and identifying False Negatives and False Positives
Prediction of Heart disease using data provided and built a heart disease predictive model and calculated the error in prediction like MSE, MAE, F2_score etc.
As Heart disease prediction is a Classification Problem. Used classification models such as Random Forest Ensemble, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree etc., and compared their results.
Identification of False negatives and False positives is more important and calculated them using confusion matrix. Also calculated the Precision and accuracy of the classification model.
